# Stochastic Process [^1][^2]
- AKA probabilistic process
- Informally, a stochastic process is a process that "evolves" in a random way.
	- This can include "when" an event occurs, what "what" occurs
	- When ->  **Ex.** The decay of a radioactive sample
		- Over time, the atoms in the sample decrease by 1, but at random moments in time
	- What
		- **Ex.** A random-walk
			- Imagine a robot on a 2D plane that moves in a random direction every second
		- **Ex.** A vacuum robot driving across the room
			- If the action a robot takes has a chance of working, but also a chance of failing due to environment factors like friction, a human suddenly walking by, etc.
- The opposite of a stochastic process is a **deterministic process**
	- Deterministic processes follow only one path
		- **Ex.** An action taken in chess
			- An action taken in chess always has an 100% chance of occurring, therefore it is deterministic
