# Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)[^1]'
- Planning has two phases
	- Learning phase
		- Repeatedly generate random free configurations of the robot
		- Connect configurations together using a simple motion planner
		- Builds an undirected graph
	- Query phase
		- Runs path finding algorithm from a source point to a destination point
			- **Ex.** [[Dijkstra Algorithm]]
- Query and learning phase could be interwoven (although this isn't covered in the paper)
	- **Ex.** First create a small roadmap. Then, augment/simplify the roadmap later on.
