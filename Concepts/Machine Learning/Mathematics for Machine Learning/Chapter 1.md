# 1 Introduction
- Core of machine learning
	- Data
	- Model
		- **Ex.** In regression, the model is a function that maps inputs to real-valued output
	- Learning
		- Automatically finding patterns and structures in data by optimizing parameters of the model
		- A model "learns" from data if it's performance on a task improves after data is taken into account
## 1.1 Finding Words for Intuitions
- **DEFINE:** Predictor
	- System that makes predictions based on input data
- **DEFINE:** Training
	- System that modifies internal parameters of a predictor so it performs well on future unseen input data
