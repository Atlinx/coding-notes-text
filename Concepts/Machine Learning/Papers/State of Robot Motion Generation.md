https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12172
- Generating robot motion
	- Traditionally used explicit models
		- Using analytical expressions for world geometry and dynamics
		- Explainable numerical approximations of dynamics, in the form of a simulator
	- New field of implicit models
		- learn implicit representations of the world task and store them as internal parameters of a machine learning model 
## Explicit models

- Motion planning
	- Generate safe paths to a goal given observations
- Task and motion planning
	- Like motion planning but for sequencing multiple goals together (generating a series of safe paths)
	- The trajectories can be executed by an open loop system if the underlying model of the task/world is accurate enough
	- **DEFINE:** Open loop system
		- System that directly executes inputs
		- **Ex.** Robot executing series of fixed instructions
	- **DEFINE:** Closed loop system
		- System that executes input, and then incorporates feedback
		- **Ex.** Robot executing a step, then collecting observations, and then deciding on the next step
- Belief state planning
	- AKA planning under uncertainty
	- Goal is to compute robust policies to disturbances that can be modelled
- Control-and-feedback planning
	- Integrates perception + motion generation so robot dynamically reacts to deviations from desired behavior given observations
### Motion Planning
- Goal is to find a path with minimal cost (shortest path or fastest trajectory) that brings a robot to a desired goal state without collisions, given fully-observable world model
- Search-based Approaches
	- Uniform cost search (UCS) + Dijkstra's algorithm
		- Compute optimal path over discrete representation of state space (ex. grid or graph), given a cost function
		- Cost function tells us the cost to transition from one state to another
	- A*
		- Uses a heuristic to inform search
	- Drawbacks of search-based approaches -> Suffers from curse of dimensionality
		- Possible states to be a explored grows exponentially with more dimensions
		- Infeasible for many robotics problems given na√Øve discretizations
- Sampling-based Motion Planners (SBMPs)
	- These methods provide graph-based representations for searching the collision-free subset of a robot's state space in a more scalable manner than grids
	- Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM)
		- Samples collision-free configurations (set of robot joint positions) as nodes of a roadmap
		- Collision-free local paths define the edges
		- **TODO:** What exactly is a roadmap?
	- Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)
		- [[Random Trees]]
		- Generates tree structure rooted at robot's start state
		- Explores free state space until it's close to the goal
			- Does not require "steering function" (the ability to perfectly connect two robot states)
				- **TODO:** What does it mean to connect two robot states?
					- What are examples of situations that don't have steering functions?
	- PRM and RRT are provably suboptimal
		- Asymptotically optimal variants (PRM* and RRT*) guarantee discovered paths converge to optimal ones as sampling progresses
			- **TODO:** What does "sampling" here mean? What is each individual sample? Is it a trajectory?
	- Applications of SBMP
		- Autonomous driving + manipulation
		- Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) has implementations
- Optimization-based approaches
	- Instead of searching entire state space, we can utilize gradient information to locally optimize our paths
	- Optimization-based approaches locally optimize paths given an objective function under physical or operational limits
	- Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning (CHOMP)
		- Iteratively optimizes paths by reducing collision and trajectory costs
	- TrajOpt
		- Uses sequence of convex optimization to progressively ensure each iteration produces feasible (satisfies all constraints) and collision-free trajectories
		- **TODO:** What is convex optimization?
	- k-Order Markov Optimization (KOMO)
		- Treats trajectory optimization as **sparse nonlinear program**
			- This is an optimization problem where objective function and/or constraints are nonlinear, and the solution is expected to have sparse representation -- only a few variables are non-zero
		- Addresses higher-dimension problems by leveraging sparsity in dynamics and constraints
		- **TODO:** What is the actual KOMO algorithm?
	- Factor graphs
		- Graphical optimization tool for state estimation and least squares optimization can be used for trajectory optimization
		- **TODO:** What exactly are factor graphs, and how is it used for state estimation?
	- Graph of Convex Sets
		- Combines optimization and SBMPs
		- Builds
	- Machine Learning (ML) for Planning
		- Using ML to improve computational efficiency of planning
			- Ex, effective sampling, avoiding collisions, distance metrics
		- ML can determine which combination of methods is best suited for a specific problem
		- Neural Motion Planning (NMP)
			- Approximates a planner's operation
			- Typically uses data from a simulator
			- Encoder processes environment data like point clouds
				- Creates a latent space representation -- a lower dimensional representation that's fed into the neural network
			- Neural network predicts robot's next configuration based on current state, goal state, and encoded environment
	- Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)
		- TAMP methods aim to address long-horizon multi-step robotic tasks
			- **Ex.** moving through sequence of goals or manipulating the environment
			- Define low level
