# Heap
#data-structure 

A heap is an implementation of a [[Priority Queue|priority queue]], that can efficiently remove the smallest/largest element of a set of elements. Specifically, a min-heap can always remove the smallest element, while a max-heap can always remove the largest element.

Heaps are used in a sorted algorithm called [[Heapsort|heap sort]]. The most common implementation of a heap is a [[Binary Heap|binary heap]]
